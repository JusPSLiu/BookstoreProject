# BookstoreProject
This was for a class project. It was made especially to run on the website, Coding Rooms, so it probably only works in Linux or something. It does run on Windows, but the Windows console window doesn't recognize the ASCII art, and the entire UI is made of ASCII art. Here's the link for the Coding Rooms page: https://app.codingrooms.com/w/6equt6HdM6Jl

The main method is in the Main.java

Also the sound effects were taken from Ace Attorney and are probably subject to copyright from Capcom or something idk.

I made the little opening music jingle myself though
